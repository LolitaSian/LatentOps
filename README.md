## Prepare Pretrained Models
There are two ways to download the pretrained models

 - Download from Onedrive and unzip into *./ckpts* folder : [Link](https://cuhko365-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/218019026_link_cuhk_edu_cn/ElZdkwSkQtRKrJ94Eh-KMAIBJfm2cwUoBVI0TbwIik06Wg?e=mWSVAj)
 - Download and process the pretrained model by running the scripts:
 
    ```
    $ bash download_pretrained_models.sh
    ```
    
    
    
    
## Outputs
To facilitate comparision, we provide the output files of text style transfer in *./outputs* folder.




***Code and pretraiend model are coming soon...***
